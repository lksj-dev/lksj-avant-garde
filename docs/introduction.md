# What is this?

You are looking at Project Avant-garde, a curated collection of example Minecraft mods for modders, old or new, veteran or amateur. 

This collection is intended to be an alterantive form of modding tutorial / docs. Every mod in this collection 
tells you the best practices on a particular topic in Minecraft modding.

Themes of these mods are carefully chosen from history of Modded Minecraft to ensure that they are good examples 
to show off “how to do X”. 

The actual code are written from scratch and released into public domain; we also commission texture artists to 
create brand new textures for use in these new mods. 

We also make sure that every mod included is minimal and focused. That said, you won't be distracted by anything 
unrelated to your goal when you read source codes of these mods. 

With the goals stated above, this is still an infant project, and it requires your feedback to grow better. 
Please, do not hensitate to report any issues or concerns!
