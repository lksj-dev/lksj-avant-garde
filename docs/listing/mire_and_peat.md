# Mire & Peat

This mod adds a renewable energy source: peat. 
You craft Mire Soil first using dirt, moss blocks and water, then place them near water source, and then wait 
for Mire Soil to mature. Harvesting mature Mire Soil gives peat and dirt.

::: tip
Despite being renewable in this mod, peat is generally considered non-renewable energy source in real life, 
for it takes *very long* time for peatland to replenish its peat deposit, and its consumption is wat more 
faster.

## History

A texture artist said he got free time and was available for commissioning textures for “anything organic”. 
With the recent work on Project Avant-garde, I recalled one thing from the Forestry for Minecraft mod: Bog Earth. 

It was a simple feature to revive in modern Minecraft versions, and it was a perfect example for showing how to 
work with random ticks. So I contacted the said artist for textures for peat block and item, and quickly cobbled 
together a working mod.
