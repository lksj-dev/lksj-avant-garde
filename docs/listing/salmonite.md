## History

The idea of this mod was firstly mentioned circa. Nov. 2023 in a group chat. 
It was intented as a pun in Chinese: its Chinese name, “鲑岩”, pronunces the same as “硅岩”; “硅岩” is one of 
Chinese names of Naquadah, a fictional element originated from *Stargate*, a Sci-Fi media franchise. 

It was brought up again in Jun. 2024; I decided to implement this idea as a part of Project Avant-garde.
