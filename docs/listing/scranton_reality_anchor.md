## History

May of 2020. I was preparing for TeaCon 2020, and I need a lot of tools for this online convention event. 

One of the possibly needed tools is a chunk loader. I was a fan of the World Anchor from Railcraft, but Railcraft has 
been stuck at 1.12.2 for a while. Further, even if Railcraft was available, I would have not wanted the entire 
Railcraft for the sake of a random in-game show-off thingy. 

So I decided to roll out an re-implementation. The mod name is a reference to the contraption with the same name from 
*SCP Fundation* series.

The code part was easy because Minecraft itself got a new command to 
force-load chunks. However, the mod did not come into fruition because it still does not have a model. 

And it turns out the `/forceload` command is enough for use in TeaCon. So the code is effectively dead.

... until now. I decided to give it a chance to revive, in the name of Project Avant-garde.
