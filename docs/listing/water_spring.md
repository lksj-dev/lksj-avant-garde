# Water Spring

This mod brings back the Water Spring block from BuildCraft. 
This block has the exact same appearance and behavior as vanilla bedrock, except that Water Spring block will 
spawn a water source block on top of it whenever it finds space above.

## History

This mod was created for testing if I could use non-English mod name and description on CurseForge and Modrinth. 
To do that, I had to upload a real content mod, and Water Spring from BuildCraft was the first thing came into my 
mind. 

It turned out that you *have to* have English mod name and description on both platforms. However, bi-lingual, or 
even multi-lingual names & descriptions are totally fine. 

The mod is then recycled for use in Project Avant-garde after the idea of “collection of example mods” was formalized.
