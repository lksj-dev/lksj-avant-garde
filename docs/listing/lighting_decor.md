# Lighting Décor

This mod adds some new decoration blocks; most, if not all, of new blocks are light source with maximum 
light level (15).

## History

May of 2019. A friend of mine reached me, requesting for a new mod adding chandeliers, to be used in a 
private server (I *think* it was a private server). Textures were commissioned by another friend of mine. 

The initial issue to solve is uncertain today. On the surface, these new blocks have no special behaviors 
comparing to other vanilla light-emitting blocks. However, this mod is clearly influenced by [Chandeliers 
from Extra Utilities](https://ftbwiki.org/Chandelier): the crafting recipe is the same, and the appearance 
is similar. However, chandeliers themselves in Lighting Décor mod does not prevent monsters from spwaning, 
only the lighting levels do.

With the birth of Project Avant-garde, I decided to include this mod, and acquired permission to reuse the 
texture from the commission artist.
