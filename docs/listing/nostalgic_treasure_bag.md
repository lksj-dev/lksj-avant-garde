## History

I made this mod for my personal modpack around April - July of 2019. Its mechanics is mostly modeled after DartCraft's 
loot bag.

The mod had never been released to public because I was reusing DartCraft's texture, whose ultimate origin, in turn, 
is also dubious.

With the help of an artist who is willing to commission on brand new texture, this mod finally got a chance to see the 
sun light.
