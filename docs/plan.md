# What do you want to do in the future?

## Some mods are untested

Need help on testing whether they work as expected.

- *Scranton Reality Anchor*

## More example mods

I have couple of ideas that I would like to implement as example mods. 

Here is the incomplete list of them:

- An ore crusher that duplicates metal ingots. This used to be a must-have for every single tech-themed mod.
- An example to show how to tint blocks/items using `BlockColor` and `ItemColor`.
- An example to show how to dynamically display tooltips based on your `ItemStack`.
- An example of multi-block.

## Missing texture & model

I need the following models and textures:

- Block models and textures for *Scranton Reality Anchor* mod:
  - All 4 varaints are missing models.
  - The GUI texture needs a revamp to match theme.

## Difficultiy ranking

Rank each example with a difficulty level. Not sure what criteria would it be.
