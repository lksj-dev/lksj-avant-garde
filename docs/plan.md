# What do you want to do in the future?

I have couple of ideas that I would like to implement as example mods. 

Here is the incomplete list of them:

- An ore crusher that duplicates metal ingots. This used to be a must-have for every single tech-themed mod.
- An example to show how to tint blocks/items using `BlockColor` and `ItemColor`.
- An example to show how to dynamically display tooltips based on your `ItemStack`.
